- scripts and projects give you a solid workflow that will serve you well in the future:
  - Create one RStudio project for each data analysis project.
  - Save your scripts (with informative names) in the project, edit them, run them in bits or as a whole. 
  - Restart R frequently to make sure you’ve captured everything in your scripts.
  - Only ever use relative paths, not absolute paths.
  - Then everything you need is in one place and cleanly separated from all the other projects that you are working on.
